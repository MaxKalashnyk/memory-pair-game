# Memory pair game

Let's play! Go to [Demo](https://kalash14.github.io/memory-pair-game/) 

It's my one of the most interesting hometasks of [Kottans](https://github.com/kottans/) frontend [course](https://github.com/Kottans/frontend).
I've also created here optional game improvement - checking the best play duration.
Developing this game was very useful for me, because it allowed to practice almost all passed course theory topics: array methods, working with date (I created a stopwatch), working with localstorage etc.
